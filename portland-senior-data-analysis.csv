Core working hours are 10am-3pm.  Compensation  While we are currently experiencing substantial growth, we are still a small company that believes in bootstrapping and forging our own path. We believe in transparency and as such want to be clear that as starting compensation we offer a comfortable, though below market salary as well a equity based on individual experience and situation. As we continue to grow we will ensure that our success is shared by the entire team.  Interested?  If so, tell us about yourself. Your background, your interests, your assessment of your skills.
